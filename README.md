# A very opinionated Clojure project template

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dryewo/cyrus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dryewo/cyrus)
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/cyrus/lein-template.svg)](https://clojars.org/cyrus/lein-template)

Includes:

* [mount] for state management
* dev/user.clj for REPL-driven development
* [timbre] for logging
* +http: [aleph] + [Compojure] (and [Ring])
* +db: PostgreSQL, [conman], [migratus], [HugSQL]
* +[nrepl]: NREPL server for remote debugging
* +[swagger1st] (RESTful API), includes +http
* Lean configuration management with [squeeze]
* useful tweaks

Roadmap:

* [Hystrix]
* Dockerfile

## Usage

```
$ lein new cyrus org.example.footeam/bar-project +http +db +nrepl
```

## Contents

### State management

[mount] is chosen over [component] for its lean spirit and ease of use.

### Logging

* Logging is supported via [timbre]. Additionally, an opinionated format is provided
via `(lib.logging/default-log-output-fn)`.
* Overlall log level can be overridden by setting `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
* Log level per namespace is configured in core.clj using `(lib.logging/set-ns-log-levels)!`. The resulting log level 
per namespace is the higher of global and specific settings.

### HTTP server

`+http` option adds a component that starts an HTTP server ([aleph]).
Example routes are provided as well as reasonable default middleware.

### Swagger1st API

`+swagger1st` adds `/api` route that is handled by a separate library: [Swagger1st].  
It allows request routing and parameter parsing based on [OpenAPI] definition in YAML format.
Highly recommended for any more or less serious API service.

Additionally exposes Swagger UI and spec:
* `/api/ui`
* `/api/swagger.json` 

This option automatically includes `+http`.

### DB access

`+db` option adds a component that includes database access layer, built on:

* [HugSQL] to generate access functions. Additionally, some interceptors are provided
  to convert `camel_case` column names to `:kebab-case` keywords in result maps.
* [conman] for connection pool.
* [migratus] for schema migrations.
  Migrations are always applied when the DB component starts up.
* PostgreSQL JDBC driver is included.
* Example schema is generated and example unit tests are provided.

PostgreSQL 9.6 for development and testing can be launched in a Docker container:

```sh
./make.sh db
```

### NREPL

`+nrepl` adds a NREPL server that is started before the main application is. It has to be enabled
by setting `NREPL_ENABLED=true`. Default port is `55000`, can be changed by setting `NREPL_PORT`. 

### Configuration management

The app can only be configured through environment variables (following [Twelve-Factor App manifesto]).
Each component defines its own schema ([prismatic/schema]), which is used to 
validate and coerce the selected environment variables during component start-up:

Having a schema like this:
```clj
(s/defschema Config
  {(s/optional-key :http-port)            s/Int
   (s/optional-key :http-whitelisted-ips) [s/Str]})
```

Only mentioned environment variables are selected and transformed according to the schema:

```
HTTP_PORT=7777
HTTP_WHITELISTED_IPS="[1.2.3.4, 4.3.2.1]"
HTTP_UNKNOWN=nfrjbqogpq-u8y7894yr984gbl
```

yields:

```clj
{:http-port            7777                    ; parsed as Int
 :http-whitelisted-ips ["1.2.3.4" "4.3.2.1"]   ; parsed as YAML
```

The environment is read from [environ] on the component start and overridden
by args given to `(mount/start-with-args)` to allow experimenting with configuration without restarting REPL every time.

### user.clj

To facilitate REPL-driven development, `user.clj` contains functions, available directly from `user` namespace after REPL is started:

* `(start)`, which calls `(mount/start-with-args)`, giving it contents of `dev-env.edn` file to override the environment (exposed by `env` component).
  This is done to enable adjusting environment variables without restarting REPL.
* `(stop)`, which calls `(mount/stop)`
* `(reset)`, which calls `(stop)`, `(refresh)` and then `(start)`
* `(tests)`, which runs all tests in all test namespaces
* functions from clojure.tools.namespace: `(refresh)`, `(refresh-all)`

## Development

In order to try the template out without releasing to clojars, install it to the local `~/.m2` and specify `--snapshot` flag:

```
$ lein install
$ cd target    # Or any other directory
$ lein new cyrus org.example.footeam/bar-project --snapshot -- +swagger1st +nrepl +db +http
```

## Testing

```
$ ./itest.sh
```

## FAQ

**Q.** Why another template? There is already [Luminus], which is more feature-rich.  
**A.** While Luminus is a great project, made with a lot of love, it already carries an opinion, which in some points is 
 different from mine. Also, even without additional options it generates too much (not always you need front-end, configuration management with cprop is IMHO an overkill etc.)
 Leiningen templates are not extensible, so I had to make my own, reusing best parts of Luminus.
