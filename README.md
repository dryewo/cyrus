## Usage

```

## Contents

### State management

[mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount) is chosen over [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component)
for its lean spirit and ease of use.

### Logging

* Logging is supported via [timbre](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre). Additionally, an opinionated format is provided
via `(lib.logging/default-log-output-fn)`.
* Overlall log level can be overridden by setting `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
* Log level per namespace is configured in core.clj using `(lib.logging/set-ns-log-levels)!`. The resulting log level 
per namespace is the higher of global and specific settings.

### HTTP server

By adding `+http` option one can include a component that starts an HTTP server ([aleph](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph)).
Example routes are provided as well as reasonable default middleware.

### DB access

`+db` option adds a component that includes database access layer, built on:

* [HugSQL](https://www.hugsql.org/) to generate access functions. Additionally, some interceptors are provided
  to convert `camel_case` column names to `:kebab-case` keywords in result maps.
* [conman](https://github.com/luminus-framework/conman) for connection pool.
* [migratus](https://github.com/yogthos/migratus) for schema migrations.
  Migrations are always applied when the DB component starts up.
* PostgreSQL JDBC driver is included.
* Example schema is generated and example unit tests are provided.
* PostgreSQL 9.6 for development and testing can be launched in a Docker container by `./make.sh db`.

### Configuration management

The app can only be configured through environment variables
(following [Twelve-Factor App manifesto](https://12factor.net/config)).
Each component defines its own schema ([prismatic/schema](https://github.com/plumatic/schema)), which is used to 
validate and coerce the selected environment variables during component start-up:

Having a schema like this:
```clj
(s/defschema Config
  {(s/optional-key :http-port)            s/Int
   (s/optional-key :http-whitelisted-ips) [s/Str})
```

Only mentioned environment variables are selected and transformed according to the schema:

```
HTTP_PORT=7777
HTTP_WHITELISTED_IPS="[1.2.3.4, 4.3.2.1]"
FOO_BAR_UNKNOWN=nfrjbqogpq-u8y7894yr984gbl
```

yields:

```clj
{:http-port            7777                    ; parsed as Int
 :http-whitelisted-ips ["1.2.3.4" "4.3.2.1"]   ; parsed as YAML
```

The environment is read from [environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ) on the component start and overridden by args given to `(mount/start)`
to allow experimenting with configuration without restarting REPL every time.

### user.clj

To facilitate REPL-driven development, `user.clj` contains functions, available directly from `user` namespace after REPL is started:

* `(start)`, which calls `(mount/start-with-args)`, giving it contents of `dev-env.edn` file to override the environment (exposed by `env` component).
  This is done to enable adjusting environment variables without restarting REPL.
* `(stop)`, which calls `(mount/stop)`
* `(reset)`, which calls `(stop)`, `(refresh)` and then `(start)`
* `(tests)`, which runs all tests in all test namespaces
* functions from clojure.tools.namespace: `(refresh)`, `(refresh-all)`

## Development

In order to try the template out without releasing to clojars, install it to the local `~/.m2` and specify `--snapshot` flag:

```
$ lein install
$ cd target    # Or any other directory
$ lein new miley-cyrus org.example.footeam/bar-project --snapshot
```

## Testing

```
$ ./itest.sh
```

## FAQ

**Q.** Why another template? There is already [Luminus](https://github.com/luminus-framework/luminus-template), which is more feature-rich.  
**A.** While Luminus is a great project, made with a lot of love, it already carries an opinion, which in some points is 
 different from mine. Also, even without additional options it generates too much (not always you need front-end, configuration management with cprop is IMHO an overkill etc.)
 Leiningen templates are not extensible, so I had to make my own, reusing best parts of Luminus.
